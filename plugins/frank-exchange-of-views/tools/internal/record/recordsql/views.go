// ViewsDDL is the fold, expressed once, where every reader can see it.
//
// # Why these are views and the tables are derived
//
// The schema comes from the descriptors because it IS the proto, restated. A projection is not:
// "which gaps are still open" is a QUESTION about the record, and questions are authored. So these
// are written, and they are written HERE rather than in each reader — which is the actual defect
// being removed. `BoardState` folds the event stream in Go and every consumer folds it again a
// little differently: the closure index, the worklist, the scorecard's denominator, the dashboard's
// counts. That is where `filed > ruled` came to compute `0 > 0` forever and where a dispute counter
// sat at zero through every run, because a fold nobody can see is a fold nobody checks.
//
// # THE BENCH ARM, AND WHAT IT COST TO EXPRESS
//
// The first cut of this file could not fold a bench closure and said so: `disposition` was a plain
// string, the bench's vocabulary was not in the database, and "does this word close the gap" was a
// Go predicate — `benchClosesGap`, whose rule was "everything except `carried`". A negative rule
// has no gap to notice, and that is not hypothetical: a deferring disposition added later was
// classified as closing by default and retired a gap the bench had deliberately kept alive.
//
// Making it an enum was the price of this join, and the join is the smaller half of what it bought.
// `closes` is now an annotation ON each value, so the vocabulary table carries it as a NOT NULL
// column and a value added without answering the question fails at build. The predicate is a
// SELECT, the schema refuses a partly-annotated set, and `merge close` may not write `carried`
// because the CHECK is expanded from the same annotation.
//
// # What a gap being closed by BOTH arms means here
//
// It is legal: red closes on a verified repair, the bench rules on the same gap in a later sitting.
// The view reports the EARLIEST closure as `closed_round`, and keeps both `closure_class` and
// `bench_disposition` visible rather than collapsing them into one word, because which act ended
// the gap is exactly the distinction #342 was about — a reader should not have to know which verb
// produced a closure, but it must still be able to ask.
