// Package hookcmd is the PreToolUse/PostToolUse backend, as its own program rather than a verb
// on the seat tool.
//
// # Why this is not a subcommand any more
//
// It was `feov-record hook pretooluse`, and hooks.json invoked it with no --seat-id because a
// hook HAS no seat id — Claude Code calls it, not a seat and not an operator. That worked only
// while "nobody said who is asking" fell through to the operator surface. When identity started
// SELECTING the surface, no-identity stopped resolving any command: the root refused the shipped
// hook's own invocation, RefuseAndTeach exits 2, and exit 2 from a PreToolUse hook DENIES the
// tool call. Matcher Write|Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit|Bash — so every mutating tool call in the
// session, for anyone whose plugin bin/ held the binary. The suite stayed green because the
// change taught eight test files to pass --seat-id, and hooks.json is the one caller that cannot
// be taught.
//
// Registering the verb outside the scoped surface fixed that instance and left the shape wrong.
// A hook backend living inside an identity-scoped command tree has to be exempted from identity,
// hidden from help, and then exempted AGAIN from the surface census — CommandPaths walks hidden
// commands, so `blue hook pretooluse` became a seat capability and three gates demanded a trigger
// row and a board that drives it. Every one of those exemptions is a symptom of the same category
// error: this is not a verb, it is a program.
//
// The suite's other eleven hooks are dedicated single-purpose binaries — prosthetic-conscience's
// nine and gray-area's one — and not one of them broke. This joins them.
//
// # The exit-code contract, enforced here rather than documented downstream
//
// EVERY ENTRY POINT RETURNS 0, whatever it decides. The decision travels in the stdout JSON; the
// exit status is not a channel. That invariant used to live in a doc comment on a leaf command,
// two levels below the argument parsing that broke it. Run() enforces it at the process boundary,
// including through a panic, because a hook that dies is a session that cannot edit files.
